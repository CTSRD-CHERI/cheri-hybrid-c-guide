This is the CHERI Hyrbid C/C++ Programming Guide, a short guide to help
developers working with hybrid capability C/C++ understand the benefits
that it brings, any code adaptations they might need to make, and how to
interpret new compiler warnings and errors that arise with pure-capability
code.

Unlike pure-capability CHERI C/C++, this variant of C/C++ is targeted at
niche use cases such as boot loaders, OS kernels, and IPC libraries, where
there is a desire to interoperate between code utilizing integer pointers
and code utilizing capability pointers.

This is a living document.
