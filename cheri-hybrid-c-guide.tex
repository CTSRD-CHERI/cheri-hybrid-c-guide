This document is a brief introduction to the \hybridCOrCpp{} programming
language.
\hybridCOrCpp{} allows the selective use of CHERI capabilities from within an
otherwise unmodified, and ABI-compatible, C/\cpp{}-language code base.
As with \purecapCOrCpp{}, described in a separate report, \hybridCOrCpp{}
enables forms of C/\cpp{}-language safety.
However, CHERI protections are applied only to specifically annotated
pointers, rather than to all pointers.
Because of the requirement for ABI compatibility, implied pointers within the
language runtime itself are also primarily implemented as integers rather than
capabilities.

\hybridCOrCpp{} primarily sees use in specialized low-level systems code: boot
loaders, operating-system kernels, and inter-process communication runtimes.
Hybrid code is used in the CheriBSD kernel, and in the userspace run-time
environment for hybrid processes to enable communication with pure-capability
processes via co-process IPC.
Because manual annotation is required, and there is limited support for
capabilities in the run-time environment, substantial additional compare is
required.

As \hybridCOrCpp{} remains an area of active research and development, this
report is a request for review and comments rather than a specification.

\subsection{Background}

This is a companion to the \textit{\purecapCOrCpp{} Programming
Guide}~\cite{UCAM-CL-TR-947}, and refers to that report rather than
replicating its contents.
Readers will benefit from first having read that document before this one, as
many behaviors in \hybridCOrCpp{} are based on those in \purecapCOrCpp{}, or
will be contrasted with it in this guide.
The report \textit{Introduction to CHERI} technical
report~\cite{UCAM-CL-TR-941} will also provide valuable background material
required to understand this guide.

\section{Objective of \hybridCOrCpp{}}

As with \purecapCOrCpp{}, \hybridCOrCpp{} allows C and \cpp{} source code to
be compiled to use architectural capabilities in the generated machine code.
Unlike \purecapCOrCpp{}, which utilizes capabilities to implement both
explicit pointers in the language (e.g., pointers declared as local variables)
and implied pointers in the runtime (e.g., return addresses), the default in
\hybridCOrCpp{} is to implement C and \cpp{} pointers using architectural
integers unless otherwise specified.
For readability, instances of pointers implemented as capabilities are
referred to as \textit{capability pointers}, and instances of pointers
implemented as integers are referred to as \textit{integer pointers}.

\subsection{\uucap{} qualifier}

To implement a pointer as a capability, the qualifier \uucap{} is used on
a pointer type.
No other language-visible pointer will be implemented as a capability.
Some implied pointers, such as those implementing global variables, are also
be implemented as capabilities, in order that capability pointers taken to
those objects have the desired capability properties (such as bounds).

\subsection{Limitations}

This is a relatively weak integration of CHERI support with the language and
run-time environment offering limited memory protection only in very specific
circumstances.
Except where Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) have been extended to
support explicit capability arguments or return values, pointers will not
be protected by capability integrity, pointer provenance validity, bounds,
permissions, or monotonicity.
For example, \cfunc{malloc} will not return pointers as capabilities with
bounds set, and also may not align or pad allocations such that they can be
bounded imprecisely without loss of spatial protection relative to adjacent
allocations.
Further, the control-flow and other data structures used by C and the C
runtime themselves do not use capabilities, and so some of the resilience to
exploitation found in \purecapCOrCpp{}, such as return addresses and stack
pointers implemented using capabilities, are not found in \hybridCOrCpp{}.
Specific limitations by protection type are:

\subsubsection{Incomplete referential, spatial, and temporal safety}

\begin{itemize}
\item Integer pointers, returned by various memory allocators by default, do
  not implement capability protections including tag, bounds, and permissions.
  As a result, integer pointers suffer from a lack of provenance validity and
  spatial safety.

\item Whenever a capability pointer type is cast to an integer pointer type,
  its capability metadata, including tag, bounds, and permissions, are lost.
  The resulting integer pointer will be dereferenced relative to the Default
  Data Capability (DDC), and uses those bounds and permissions, which may be
  substantial, and provenance validity is not implemented.

\item Whenever an integer pointer type is cast to a capability pointer type,
  the compiler will derive the new capability from DDC without refining its
  bounds or permissions, offering provenance validity but not privilege
  minimization.

\item Both explicit function pointers and implied pointers such as return
  addresses and PLT entries are implemented as integer pointers, and therefore
  lack provenance validity, bounds, and permissions.

\item Other data structures implemented by the language runtime and compiler,
  such as the stack, are also implemented using integer pointers that do not
  implement provenance validity, bounds, or permissions.

\item CHERI temporal safety relies on capability implementation of pointers,
  so that the tag, bounds, and permissions can be utilized to detect stale
  pointers to quarantined memory.
  As many pointers in a hybrid program are implemented using integers,
  temporal safety is unable to precisely find all pointers or arrange for
  their suitably atomic replacement.
\end{itemize}

As a result of these limitations, privilege minimization in the language
runtime, control-flow mechanisms, and user data types is largely unimplementd.
Protections are only refined and enforced for programmer-selected types, which
can offer substantial value in specific scenarios, but is not a source of
general robustness for the C and C++ implementations.
All privilege reductions are programmer-implemented through explicit calls to
narrow bounds and permissions.

\subsection{Use cases}

Despite these limitations, \hybridCOrCpp{} is an invaluable tool in specific
programming environments; for example:

\begin{description}
\item[Hybrid CheriBSD kernel]
  The \hybridCOrCpp{} compiled CheriBSD kernel is almost entirely
  conventional C/\cpp{} implemented using integer pointers, except for its
  handling of system-call arguments and capability state, which is manually
  annotated.

\item{Co-process IPC libraries in hybrid processes}

\item XXX More?

\section{Recommended use of C-language types}
\label{sec:recommended-c-types}

\rwnote{This needs updating for hybrid use.}

As confusion frequently arises about the most appropriate types to use for
integers, pointers, and pointer-related values, we make the following
recommendations:

\begin{description}
\item[\cintt, \cintttt, \clongt, \cintsft,
  \ldots{}] These pure integer types should be used to hold integer values
  that will never be cast to a pointer type without first combining them with
  another pointer value -- e.g., by using them as an array offset.
  Most integers in a C/\cpp{}-language program will be of these types.

\item[\ptraddrt] This is a new integer type introduced by CHERI C and should be used to hold
  addresses.
  \ptraddrt should not be directly cast to a pointer type for
  dereference; instead, it must be combined with an existing valid capability
  to the address space to generate a dereferenceable pointer.
  Typically, this is done using the \ccode{cheri\_address\_set(c, x)} function.

\item[\sizet, \ssizet] These integer types should be used
  to hold the unsigned or signed lengths of regions of address space.
  \arnote{\sizet not necessary the same as unsigned \ptrdifft.}

\item[\ptrdifft] This integer type describes the difference of indices
  between two pointers to elements of the same array, and should not be used for
any other purpose.
  It can be added to a pointer to obtain a new pointer, but the result will
  be dereferenceable only if the address lies within the bounds of the
  pointer from which it was derived.

  \note{Isn't that last sentence true of any combination?}{nwf}

  Less standards-compliant code sometimes uses \ptrdifft when the
  programmer more likely meant \cintptrt or (less commonly)
  \sizet.
  When porting code, it is worthwhile to audit use of \ptrdifft.

  \note{Should we recommend that \sizet be used to hold lengths of
  allocations and \ptrdifft be used to talk about spans of
  address space (e.g., the offsets between two subobjects of an allocation)?  I feel
  like the recommendations here are not as concrete as I'd like.}{nwf}

\item[\cintptrt, \cuintptrt] These integer types should be
  used to hold values that may be valid pointers if cast back to a pointer
  type.
  When an \cintptrt is assigned an integer value -- e.g., due to
  constant initialization to an integer in the source -- and the result is
  cast to a pointer type, the pointer will be invalid and hence
  non-dereferenceable.
  These types will be used in two cases: (1) Where there is uncertainty as to
  whether the value to be held will be an integer or a pointer -- e.g., for an
  opaque argument to a callback function; or (2) Where it is more convenient
  to place a pointer value in an integer type for the purposes of arithmetic
  (which takes place on the capability's address and in units of bytes, as if
  the pointer had been cast to \texttt{char *}).

  The observable, integer range of a \cuintptrt is the same as
  that of a \ptraddrt (or \ptrdifft for \cintptrt), despite the increased \emph{alignment} and \emph{storage} requirements.

\item[\ccode{intmax\_t}, \ccode{uintmax\_t}] According to the C standard\arnote{7.20.1.5 Greatest-width integer types}, these integer types should be \enquote{capable of representing any value of any (unsigned) integer type}.
  In \purecapCOrCpp{}, they are not provenance-carrying and can represent the integer \emph{range} of \cuintptrt/\cintptrt, but not the capability metadata or tag bit.
  As the observable value of \cuintptrt/\cintptrt is the pointer address range, we believe this choice to be compatible with the C standard.

  Additionally, due to ABI constraints, it would be extremely difficult to change the width of these types from 64 to 129 bits.
  This is also true for other architectures such as x86: despite Clang and GCC supporting an \ccode{\_\_int128} type, \ccode{intmax\_t} remains 64 bits wide.

  We generally do not recommend use of these types in \purecapCOrCpp{}.
  However, the types may be useful in \cfunc{printf} calls (using the \ccode{\%j} format string width modifier) as the \pathname{inttypes.h} \ccode{PRI*} macros can be rather verbose.


\item[\maxalignt] This type is defined in C as \enquote{an object type whose alignment is the greatest fundamental alignment} \arnote{C2x \S{}7.19.2} and this includes capability types for \purecapCOrCpp{}.
% and in \cpp{} as a \enquote{type whose alignment requirement is at least as great as that of every scalar type}\arnote{C++17 \S{}21.2.4p5}
We found that some custom allocators use \ccode{sizeof(long double)} or \ccode{sizeof(uint64\_t)} to align their return values.
While this appears to work on most architectures, in \purecapCOrCpp{} this must be changed to \ccode{alignof(\maxalignt)}\kern-2pt.%
%
\footnote{%
It is important to use \ccode{alignof} instead of \ccode{sizeof} since many
common implementations, such as GCC and FreeBSD, define \maxalignt as a
\ccode{struct} and not a \ccode{union}.}

\item[\ccharstar, \ldots{}] These pointer types are suitable for
  dereference, but in general \psnote{that ``in general'' makes me wonder about the exceptions?}
  \arnote{The only exception I can think of is requiring \cvoidstar due to bad API design (callback parameters, etc).}  should not be cast to or from arbitrary integer
  values.
  Valid pointers are always derived from other valid pointers (including those cast to \cintptrt or \cuintptrt), and cannot be
  constructed using arbitrary integer arithmetic.
\end{description}

It is important to note that \cuintptrt is no longer the same size as
\sizet. This difference may require making some changes to
existing code to use the correct type depending on whether the variable
needs to be able store a pointer type. In cases where this is not obvious
(such as for a callback argument), we recommend the use of \cuintptrt.
This ensures that provenance is maintained.

\pgnnote{The above section begs questions relating to what is the
  responsibility of programmers and what can be aided or managed by
  compilers.  Ideally, the latter would be preferable to requiring
  programmers to understand things are possibly beyond their so-called
  experience.}
